# import-Excel-files-into-Google-Sheets
Import Excel files from a Google Drive folder and append the data into a Google Sheet. This script is written to be used on a Sheets-bound script, and will import the data from Excel files in a specified Drive folder and append the data to a single Google Sheets tab, and then archive the Excel file after processing.

This works great if you have software or a service that will drop a Excel file in a specific Drive folder every day or week, and then you can set up this script on a timed trigger to process and import the data.
